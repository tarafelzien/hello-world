This repository will be the focal point of learning about how Github works.

Hello world!
My name is Tara Felzien. I've been studying Computer Science since 2014, and although I've had difficult days learning concepts or understanding a subject that didn't just "click", I've enjoyed the intersting questions it asks and problems that need to be solved.

I graduate December 2018, and I'm excited to start my career in this field. I've had experience outside of school, including a summer of research for security and privacy in computing. I've also worked in two internships.  My first internship was with a company called Crucial which is a subsidary of Micron.  My current internship is at Kount where I work as an SDET where I develop tests and work on a testing framework to ensure that the software being delpoyed is properly observed and stretched to ensure that it works as it should according to Acceptence Criteria.

Thanks for reading my hello world README!! 

Whatever day it is, I hope that it's a wonderful day. :)

Best,
Tara
